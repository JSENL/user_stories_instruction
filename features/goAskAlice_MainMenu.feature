/**
 * discussion: 1st comment from Kay:
 * Looks like stories are talking about content of menus instead of features.
 * User stories about menus should be limited to the behaviors and layout; please
 * ignore the actual menu item names. Behaviors are different on narrow displays
 * (e.g. mobile phones) from those on wide displays. The stories need to capture
 * these differences.
 * For referring to the different menus themselves, let's use the following:
 * - Main menu (on top on wide displays)
 * - Secondary menu (in sidebar on wide displays)
 * - Tertiary menu (in footer on wide displays)

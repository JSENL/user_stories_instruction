As a student who has likes to party,
I can look at the Alcohol & Other Drugs tab,
So that I can see what are the after or side effects of its usage.

As an interested student about health issues,
I can look at the health answers button on the toolbar
So that I can choose an available subject for me to use/read.

As a user interested in learning more about masturbation,
I can use type the word into the search bar on the top right corner
So that I can find only stories or info about that topic.

      /** discussion **
       * 1st general comment from Kay:
       *   Many of these stories are very useful and clearly written. Nice work!
       *   Others need revision. I've commented on 2 that need more attention. The comments apply to others. Mind doing another iteration?
       *   The most persistent concern is with requirements (2nd line) that are too generic, or simply not described.
       *   It seems you use the word 'click' often in that line, and users probably don't care that the software lets them click; users are there to do more useful things. Describe users' requirements vs the mechanics of the current implementation.
       *   Nice job on spotting and reporting bugs! When you get the chance, please add screenshots (including the whole screen is best).
       /** discussion **
        * 1st comment from Kay: Needs revision. I'm not sure the benefit you describe is one visitors would typically require
        (reads roughly like "please take me elsewhere"... calgon? [grin] ). Without understanding the reason, I'm not sure the rest makes sense.
        Also, can you shorten and clarify the Feature name?
